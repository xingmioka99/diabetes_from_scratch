##  Project Overview
This project implements a **Logistic Regression** machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on 16 clinical signs and symptoms.

Using the "Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset," the model identifies the strongest predictors—such as **Polyuria** (excessive urination) and **Polydipsia** (excessive thirst)—to classify individuals into "Positive" or "Negative" risk categories. This serves as a diagnostic support tool to help prioritize high-risk patients for further clinical testing.



##  Key Features
The model processes the following patient data points:

* **Demographics:** Age and Gender.
* **Primary Symptoms:** Polyuria, Polydipsia, Polyphagia, and Sudden Weight Loss.
* **Secondary Indicators:** Visual blurring, Itching, Irritability, Delayed healing, and Alopecia.
* **Physical Risk Factors:** Obesity, Muscle Stiffness, and Partial Paresis.
